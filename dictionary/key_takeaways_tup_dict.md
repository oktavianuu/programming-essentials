### Key takeaways: tuples and dictionaries

1. What happens when you attempt to run the following snippet?
```python
my_tup = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tup[2])
```
The program will print ```3``` to the screen.

2. What is the output of the following snippet?
```python
tup = 1, 2, 3
a, b, c = tup 

print(a * b * c)
```
The program will print ```6``` to the screen. The tup tuple elements have been "unpacked" in the a, b, and c variables.

3. Complete the code to correctly use the count() method to find the number of duplicates of 2 in the following tuple.
```python
tup = 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 2, 8, 9
duplicates = tup.count(2)

print(duplicates) # # outputs: 4
```

4. Write a program that will "glue" the two dictionaries (```d1``` and ```d2```) together and create a new one (```d3```).
```python


```
