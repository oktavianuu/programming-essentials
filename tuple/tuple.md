### What is Tuple?
look at the following code:
```python
tuple_1 = (1, 2, 4, 5)
tuple_2 = (1., .5, .25, .125)
```
The above example showed us two tuples containing four elements. If we print them, this is what we see on our console:
```
(1, 2, 4, 5)
(1., .5, .25, .125)
```
#### How to create tuple?
This is how:
```python
empty_tuple = ()
```
When we create tuple, we need parenthesis. It is important to remember that forgetting commas won't spoil the program, instead, we will get two single variables, not tuple.
