# Sequence type is data type in python which is able to store more than one value (or less than one, as a sequence may be empty), 
# and this values can be sequentially (hence the name) browsed, element by element.
# for loop is a tool specifically designed to iterate over sequence, in other words, sequence is data which can be scanned by the for loop.
# mutability is a property of any python's data that describes it's readiness to be freely changed during program execution.
# Two kinds of python's data based on its mutability: mutable and immutable.
# mutable data can be freely updated at any times meanwhile, immutable data is the opposite.
