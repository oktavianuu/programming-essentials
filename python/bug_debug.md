## bug vs debug

Debugger can be used to fight bug(s), while the process of huntung bugs is called debugging. Debugging means we hunt, investigate, and kill bug(s). In order to do that, we need debugger; a sepcial tool, a piece of software that can control how our program is executed. With debugger, we can execute program line by line, inspects all the variables' states and change their values on demand without changing the source code, stop program execution when certain conditions are or aren't met and do a lot of useful taks, help you to debug a program.
