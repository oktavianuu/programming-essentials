### FUNTION

Function is a special piece of code we can use to to certain task. One of the most important feature is that once a function has been created, it can be used anywhere within our code.

#### Parameter

Parameters are similar to variable but only live inside functions. To use parameter in a function, we use the following convention:
```python
function_name(parameter):
    funtion_body
```
We may apply multiple parameters as many as we wish:
```python
function_name(parameter1, paramater2, parameter3):
    function_body
```
#### What is the use of parameters?
In order to make use of parameters, we call the function with argument. Argument is the variable we use to access parameters. Here is the syntax:
```python
funtion_name(argument) # function call with argument 

function_name(argument1, argument2, argument3) # function call with more than one argument.
```
After we call the function, the value we enter in the argument will be transferefed to the parameters and will be executed based on the rule of function's body. 

#### positional vs keyword parameter/argument
