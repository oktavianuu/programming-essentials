### FUNCTION: Overview
* Function can call other function or itself.
* When a function call itself known as recursion.
* The function which calls itself and contains a specified termination condition (i.e., the base case - a condition which doesn't tell the function to make any further calls to that function) is called a recursive function. 
* We can use recursive functions in python to write clean, elegant code and divide it into smaller, organized chunks. On the other hand, we need to be very careful as it might be easy to make a mistake and create a function which never terminates.
* We also need to remember that recursive calls consume a lot of memory, and therefore may sometimes be inneficient.
* When using recursion, we need to take all its advantages and disadvantages into consideration.
